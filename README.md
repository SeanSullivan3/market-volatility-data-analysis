# Market Return and Volatility Trend Analysis on the S&P500

"I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men." Sir Isaac Newton, 1720, after losing a fortune on stock market speculation.  
Issac Newton and I are very much alike, we both learned calculus during global pandemics, we both enjoy spending our savings on speculatory bull market trading strategies, and we are both decent with numbers. Unfortunately, Newton will never experience coding in Python and free access to 10 years worth of daily price data on the S&P500. So I will do what we both know Newton would have done had he been privy to these technologies, I will try to calculate the madness of men.  

This project is study on daily trends in market returns and volatility to build a predicitve model for the S&P500. I use probability theory and inferential statistics to build this model and display my results.
